▹ Round 1 – Machine Coding (90 minutes)

In this round, I received a detailed document describing the machine coding problem. It included all the mandatory features that had to be implemented. The task was to design a flight booking system supporting the following functionalities:

- Register flights
- Book flights
- Find different routes
- Sort based on cost and time
- Search flights

Additionally, there were bonus requirements such as meal filters and other optional filters that could be implemented if time permitted.

While coding, we were expected to apply basic OOP principles and relevant design patterns. After completing the implementation, we had to zip the project and email it to the provided address.

Important notes provided:

- Use an in-memory database (no DB configuration required)
- Code should be modular and extensible
- AI assistance was not allowed
- Internet could be used only for syntax reference



Things that are left out:
- Booking details are not getting saved in the storage
- sorting left out
- search flights are left out
